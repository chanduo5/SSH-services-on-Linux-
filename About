SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to securely connect to remote systems over a network. It provides a secure channel in an unsecured network by encrypting the data transmitted between the client and server. Here's how it works:

1 :- Authentication: The client initiates a connection request to the SSH server, which authenticates the user using various methods like passwords, public keys, or other authentication mechanisms.
2 :- Encryption: Once authenticated, SSH establishes an encrypted connection, ensuring that all data transferred is secure and protected from eavesdropping.
3 :- Command Execution: The client can now execute commands on the remote server, manage files, and perform other administrative tasks as if they were physically present at the server's location.
